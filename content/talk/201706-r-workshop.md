I recently did a short workshop for R Beginners together with Anders Schmidt. Anders wrote a short blogpost about what we covered and the materials we used, which is available [here](https://andersschmidt.github.io/Rstat-course/). It was really interesting to use the [`learnr`](//learnr.rstudio.com) package, and we will probably try to extend on this for future workshops.
