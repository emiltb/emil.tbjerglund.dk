# Biography
I am a Ph.d.-student in Nanoscience at the Organic Surface Chemistry group at iNANO, Aarhus University. My current research is in electrochemical production and functionalisation of graphene for use in polymer composites. I also enjoy discussing Open Science, and try engage more open and clear communication of research and analysis methods.
