abstract = "Using a one-step electropolymerisation procedure, CO$_2$ absorbing microporous carbazole-functionalised films of iron porphyrins are prepared in a controlled manner. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO$_2$ for these films is investigated to elucidate their efficiency and the origin of their ultimate degradation."
